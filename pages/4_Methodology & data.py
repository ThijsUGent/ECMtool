        AIDRES (Advancing Industrial Decarbonisation by Assessing the Future Use of Renewable Energies in Industrial Processes) is an EU-funded project supporting the decarbonisation of European industry through data-driven analysis, modelling and mapping.

        ---

        ### Overview

        AIDRES develops and integrates:

        - A detailed **database** of energy-intensive industrial sites across the EU-27, mapped at NUTS-3 level.
        - **Techno-economic models** to simulate decarbonisation scenarios by 2030 and 2050 for key industrial sectors.
        - A **geographical and resource-matching framework** to identify the optimal use of renewable energy in industry.
        - A methodology for **industrial symbiosis**, exploring shared heat, energy, and carbon flows at cluster level.

        ---

        ### Project Objectives

        - Assess how industrial demand for electricity, and energy feedstocks can shift to **renewable sources**.
        - Develop pathways combining **electrification**, **green hydrogen**, **carbon capture**, and **process innovation**.
        - Map and match **local renewable energy supply potential** with **industrial energy demand**.
        - Support EU industrial and energy policy with spatially explicit data and techno-economic insights.

    ENSPRESO (Energy System Potentials for Renewable Energy Sources) is a **comprehensive open dataset** developed by the **Joint Research Centre (JRC)** of the European Commission.  
    It provides detailed, EU-wide, **spatially explicit data** on the potentials of renewable energy sources (RES) to support long-term energy system modelling and policy analysis.

    ---

    ### Overview

    ENSPRESO includes:

    - **Biomass potentials** (agricultural residues, forestry, waste streams, energy crops).  
    - **Wind energy potentials** (onshore and offshore, with land-use restrictions).  
    - **Solar energy potentials** (PV and CSP, considering geospatial constraints).  
    - Spatial resolution at **NUTS-0, NUTS-2, and grid levels**, harmonised across the EU-28.  

    The database is designed to be compatible with **energy system models** such as PRIMES, JRC-EU-TIMES, and other techno-economic models used for EU energy scenarios.

    ---

    ### Project Objectives

    - Provide a **consistent and harmonised database** of RES potentials across Europe.  
    - Support EU energy and climate policy with transparent, **open-access datasets**.  
    - Enable detailed **scenario analysis** for renewable deployment up to 2050.  
    - Facilitate research on **energy transition pathways** and regional resource availability.
