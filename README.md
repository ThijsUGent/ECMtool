# RES2Go Tool  

## Description of the Tool  
The tool originates from the **AIDRES project**, designed to create a variety of energy demand projections for industrial sites and clusters.  
It supports high levels of **product, process, and location-based flexibilities and functionalities**.  

With RES2Go, users can:  
- Forecast energy pathways by modifying products and processes.  
- Create clusters at **micro- to macro-level**.  
- Assess the **future demand of multiple energy vectors**.
