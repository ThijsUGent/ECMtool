# explanation of the tool
Main purpose is to increase the accessibility to the data from the AIDRES project. 
In addition to the mix routes, many more cluster configurations can be generated.
user interface to manipulate the data and create new configurations

Linked to industry database to retrieve capacity, with DBSCAN pre-processing
or just to manually create a cluster (user-defined capacities)
define utilisation rates (also editable by users)

# additional features to the tool
nice visualisations 
timing of investments can be altered by users
KPIs for each cluster: climate neutrality target reached? aggregated flexilibility, other trackers?


# Background information on the AIDRES project

# Data management of the tool
include flowchart that shows how the tool functions, data inputs and outputs, show references and data sources

# Terminology used
sector: AIDRES includes six sectors; chemicals, cement, steel, refinery, fertilisers, glass
product: specific activity of that sector (again AIDRES scope defined)
production route: refers to the selected production process for that activity in a sector
cluster configuration: a user-defined configuration that defines for each included sector and product, the composition of production routes. if just one, simple, if multiple weights need to be defined by the user

# How to install ?

From VSCode, create a new python environment .venv, install requirments.txt (from terminal, activate environment, and run pip -r requirements.txt) 

# up for discussion
- fuel versus feedstock, where needed more nuance
- labels for the production routes, good reasoning behind it that will guide users when they configure clusters
to think about for future research
- what will the tool be used for, are the cluster configurations a cause or consequence

# Tasks

# To do 

- Define category

- Make a tool to select scenario from the category for each product

- Make a function to create a map 

- Make a function to create a tree map

- Make a function to create a flow diagram 

- Cluster customisation 

- To complete...
