# Description of the tool 
The tool starts from the AIDRES project, creating a variety of energy demand projections for industrial sites and clusters with a high level of product, process and location-based flexibilities and functionalities. Users can forecast energy pathways by modifying products and processes, creating clusters at micro to macro-level, and assess future demand of multiple energy vectors.


# Next features to the tool
Cluster configuration feature 

# Background information on the AIDRES project
cf website


# Terminology used
sector: AIDRES includes six sectors; chemicals, cement, steel, refinery, fertilisers, glass
product: specific activity of that sector (again AIDRES scope defined)
production route: refers to the selected production process for that activity in a sector
cluster configuration: a user-defined configuration that defines for each included sector and product, the composition of production routes. if just one, simple, if multiple weights need to be defined by the user
