            ### ECM Research Group at Ghent University

            The Energy and Cluster Management (ECM) group at Ghent University focuses on sustainable energy systems, industrial symbiosis, and the optimisation of material and energy flows. The group brings together interdisciplinary research on energy efficiency, cluster-scale integration, and life cycle assessment, aiming to support the transition to a low-carbon economy.

            ### AIDRES Project

            The AIDRES project, funded by the European Commissionâ€™s Directorate-General for Energy (DG ENER), aims to develop AI-powered digital tools to facilitate industrial decarbonisation. By identifying, evaluating, and optimising opportunities for resource and energy symbiosis within and between industrial clusters, AIDRES supports both industries and policymakers in accelerating the transition to a more circular and climate-neutral economy.
